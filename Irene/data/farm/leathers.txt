You should try to avoid the __Misthollow Hunters__ in this area, unless you also want to get Stonehide Leather.\n\nDon't skip the small pool when you start running back to the __Meredil Thrashmaws__, there are usually 6-7 turtles there.\n\n2. At Sundered Shoals, you will mainly find __Coastal Snappers__ and __Leyscar Scuttlers__. They both drop Stormscale when skinned, so this one is also a decent place for farming.

You should also pull the deers with the snarlers.\n\nYou can get two really good buffs in Suramar which speed up your farming:\n\n:bbul: __Warpwalking__ - You can get from __Chief Telemancer Oculeth__ at Shal'Aran.\n:bbul: __Ley Infusion__ - You can get this buff in caves around Suramar from small pillars called __Ley Ward__. The closest one to Shal'aran is at __(41.53, 38.96)__. It costs 25 Ancient Mana. For lower geared characters this is a must-have buff.

These mobs cast a defensive spell which lasts for around 4 seconds and reduces their damage taken by 50%.
