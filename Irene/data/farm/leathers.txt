	a1_highmountain >>> Area 1 - Highmountain >>> "There are so many __Coldscale Gazecrawlers__ at this place that you will never have to wait for respawns.

Don't pull more than one if you are a melee and can't AoE stun them while they are casting the stun." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/stormscale-basi-highmountain.jpg
	a2_suramar >>> Area 2 - Suramar >>> "There are two good places at Suramar where you can farm Stormscale.\n\n1. You will mainly farm __Meredil Thrashmaws__ here, but the respawn rate is not fast enough to farm here without downtime. Therefore, while you wait for the respawn, you can make a small lap towards the second stage of the river and kill __Lowland Hardshells__, then go back to where you started farming. You should try to avoid the __Misthollow Hunters__ in this area, unless you also want to get Stonehide Leather.\n\nDon't skip the small pool when you start running back to the __Meredil Thrashmaws__, there are usually 6-7 turtles there.\n\n2. At Sundered Shoals, you will mainly find __Coastal Snappers__ and __Leyscar Scuttlers__. They both drop Stormscale when skinned, so this one is also a decent place for farming. The mobs are a bit spread apart, so it's harder to pull more than one together." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/stormscale-suramar.jpg

The best way to farm here is to pull 6-7 together with your mount, then AoE them down (2-4 if you have bad gear). You should also pull the deers with the snarlers.\n\nYou can get two really good buffs in Suramar which speed up your farming:\n\n:bbul: __Warpwalking__ - You can get from __Chief Telemancer Oculeth__ at Shal'Aran.\n:bbul: __Ley Infusion__ - You can get this buff in caves around Suramar from small pillars called __Ley Ward__. The closest one to Shal'aran is at __(41.53, 38.96)__. It costs 25 Ancient Mana. For lower geared characters this is a must-have buff. If someone uses one pillar it will disappear, but the respawn rate is only around 2-3 minutes. There are 4-5 spawn locations in the cave." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/stonehide-leather-suramar.jpg

You can stay on the spot marked on the map, and then you can basically stand in one place with a ranged class and just keep pulling mobs from left and right, they will keep respawning. These mobs cast a defensive spell which lasts for around 4 seconds and reduces their damage taken by 50%. With good enough gear that buff on the mobs won't matter that much, but if you have burst AoE abilites, try to always wait a bit if you see the debuff on them, it's very noticable because they become a bit transparent.\n\nExact spot coordinates: (73.5, 70.6)" >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/fiendish-leather-krokuun.jpg
