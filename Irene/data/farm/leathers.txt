Look for the Temple of Atal'Hakkar on the map, it's in the middle of the large body of water if you haven't explored yet (69, 54). Go to the top of the temple first, then you have to go underwater.\n\n__Important!__ Mobs will start despawning before you can skin them if you pull the whole instance, so you should do the pull in two parts! I usually pull everything until the dragon bosses, then pull the rest on my way out.\n\nOne run takes 4-5 minutes, and you can expect around 60 leather each run, but half will be Rugged Leather.\n\nAfter you clear the instance, run out, then reset it by right-clicking over your portrait, and then clicking "Reset all instances". You can only do 10 instance runs in an hour." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/thick-leather-sunken-temple.jpg
	a3_badlands >>> Area 3 - Badlands >>> "*The recommended skinning skill for farming Thick Leather is around 240.*\n\nThe best place to farm Thick Leather is in Badlands if you can't farm Blackrock Depths. If you kill __Nyxondra's Broodling__ near New Kargath, you will get Thick Leather 90% of the time. They are only a few feet apart from each other and they will respawn before you clear the area." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/thick-leather-badlands.jpg
	a4_ungorocrater >>> Area 4 - Un'Goro Crater >>> "*The recommended skinning skill for farming Thick Leather is around 240.*\n\nAnother good place is in Un'Goro Crater. The __Ravasaurs__ there drop the same amount of Thick Leather as the whelps in Badlands, but they are far from each other and it's a bit harder to kill them." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/thick-leather-ungoro.jpg

	a1_onyxiaslair >>> Area 1 - Onyxia's Lair >>> "*The recommended skinning skill for farming Rugged Leather is around 280.*\n\nThe best place to get a lot of Rugged Leather is Onyxia's Lair at Dustwallow Marsh in Kalimdor. Onyxia's Lair is a level 30 raid.\n\nThere are 4 __Onyxian Warders__ inside Onyxia's Lair. They can drop up to 20 Rugged Leather each, but they also drop Rugged Hide, so the number of leathers you get will vary a lot.\n\n__DON'T KILL ONYXIA!__ You can't reset the trash mobs if you kill the boss.\n\nAfter you clear the instance, run out, then reset it by right-clicking over your own portrait, and then clicking "Reset all instances". You can only do 10 instance runs in an hour.\n\nSometimes you will get Rugged Hide from all 4 mobs, but after 10 runs, you will still have more Rugged Leather than any other farming place.\n\n__If the mobs don't drop any leather when you skin them__, learn Outland Skinning. This is a known bug, and for some reason, learning Outland Skinning seems to fix it for most people." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/rugged-leather-ony.jpg
	a2_blastedlands >>> Area 2 - Blasted Lands >>> "*The recommended skinning skill for farming Rugged Leather is around 280.*\n\nBlasted Lands is the best place to farm Rugged Leather if you can't farm at Onyxia's Lair. You will skin __Ashmane Boars__, and other various beasts like __Snickerfang Hyenas__, __Felhounds__ etc.\n\n__NOTE:__ If you are level 50, half of this area will be phased, and there will be a bunch of different mobs there instead of the beasts. If you talk to __Zidormi__, she will allow you to switch between phases." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/rugged-leather-blasted.jpg
	a3_winterspring >>> Area 3 - Winterspring >>> "*The recommended skinning skill for farming Rugged Leather is around 280.*\n\n__Ice Thistle Yetis__ in Winterspring have about only a 60% chance to drop Rugged Leather when skinned, so you will also get a lot of Thick Leather. This drop rate is lower than the drop rate in Blasted Lands, however, these mobs are a lot closer to each other and there are a lot of them, which makes this a great place to farm Rugged Leather. There is a cave at this spot, you should go and farm inside the cave." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/rugged-leather-winterspring.jpg

	a1_uldaman >>> Area 1 - Uldaman >>> "*__Important!__ Heavy Hide has a really low drop rate, around 3-5%.*\n\nUldaman is located at Badlands, but it's only recommended for higher level players.\n\nJust simply clear bats, scorpions, and basilisks at the marked area. The fastest way is to pull everything then kill them all at one place.\n\nThe instance has two entrances, it's easier to enter from [this one](https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/uldman-second-entrance.jpg).\n\nAfter you clear the instance, don't use the exit gate at the start, run to the one marked on the maps since it's closer. Run out, then reset Uldaman by right-clicking over your own portrait, and then clicking "Reset all instances".\n\nYou can only do 10 instance runs in an hour." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/heavy-leather-uldaman.jpg
	a2_feralas >>> Area 2 - Feralas >>> "*__Important!__ Heavy Hide has a really low drop rate, around 3-5%.*\n\nYou can farm Heavy Hide by killing __Feral Scar Yetis__ or __Rage Scar Yetis__ in Feralas." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/heavy-leather-feralas.jpg
	a3_dustwallowmarsh >>> Area 3 - Dustwallow Marsh >>> "*__Important!__ Heavy Hide has a really low drop rate, around 3-5%.*\n\nNext one is in Dustwallow Marsh, the area is full of beasts.

	a4_westernplaguelands >>> Area 4 - Western Plaguelands >>> "*__Important!__ Heavy Hide has a really low drop rate, around 3-5%.*\n\nIn Western Plaguelands there is an area around The Mender's Stead where you can kill and skin __Hulking Plaguebears__ and __Diseased Wolves__." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/heavy-leather-western-plaguelands.jpg
