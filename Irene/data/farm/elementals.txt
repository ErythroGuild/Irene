	a1_twilighthighlands >>> Area 1 - Twilight Highlands >>> "Sometimes you farm for 15 minutes and you don't get a single Volatile, this is just bad luck.\n\nFishing in Pools of Fire at Twilight Highlands is the best place to farm Volatile Fire.\n\nIf your fishing skill is only 1, you can still fish in Pool of Fire. Each pool contains 2-4 catches, each of which will be 1 or 2 Volatile Fire. The location have 4 pool spawning points, but no more than 2 pools will be visible at one time, and none may be visible if pools have recently been fished empty. Pools respawn approximately 12-15 minutes.\n\nYou can find the Pools around __Lord Canon__, and [this is how the Pool of Fire looks like](https://www.wow-professions.com/images/pool-of-fire-twilight-highlands.jpg). If you can do this alone, you will get 100+ Volatile Fire in an hour.\n\nKill __Enslaved Infernos__ while you wait for the pools to respawn because they can also drop Volatile Fire (14%)." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/volatile-fire-twilight.jpg
	a2_mounthyjal >>> Area 2 - Mount Hyjal >>> "Sometimes you farm for 15 minutes and you don't get a single Volatile, this is just bad luck.\n\n__Flame Ascendants__ in Mount Hyjal have low HP and they respawn really fast. There are around 8-9 of these guys at the marked area, you can see the spawn points on the map below, they spawn pretty close to each other. The best way to farm here is to kill 1-3, loot them, then mount up and move to the next spawn point. Just move in a circle around the spawn points.\n\nThere is also [another Pool of Fire location in Mount Hyjal](https://i.imgur.com/WMlB4Oo.png). This is a good place for lower levels to farm Volatile Fire because there are no mobs at this area." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/volatile-fire-hyjal3.jpg
	a3_mounthyjal >>> Area 3 - Mount Hyjal >>> "Sometimes you farm for 15 minutes and you don't get a single Volatile, this is just bad luck.\n\nA good alternative is farming __Flame Terrors__ and __Brimstone Destroyers__ in Mount Hyjal, but you can only see these mobs if you completed the starting quests at Mount Hyjal, and then I think you also need to complete the quest chain __Guardians of Hyjal: Firelands Invasion!__." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/volatile-fire-hyjal2.jpg
	a4_twilighthighlands >>> Area 4 - Twilight Highlands >>> "Sometimes you farm for 15 minutes and you don't get a single Volatile, this is just bad luck.\n\nFarming __Unbound Emberfiends__ in Twilight Highlands is another good place, these are a lot harder to kill than the mobs in Mount Hyjal if you don't have a high level character." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/volatile-fire-twilight2.jpg

They are also fishable in open waters in Cataclysm zones.\n\nSometimes you farm for 15 minutes and you don't get a single Volatile, this is just bad luck.\n\nYou can get Volatile Water by killing __Muddied Water Elementals__ in Twilight Highlands.\n\nI couldn't test this, but I have seen reports that if you have the __Muddied Waters__ quest active in your quest log, they won't drop any Volatile Water, so make sure to turn in the quest." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/volatile-water-twilight-highlands.jpg

	a1_zulgurub >>> Area 1 - Zul'Gurub >>> "Zul'Gurub is a level 35 Heroic dungeon, so you should be able to solo this instance at around level 40.\n\n[The entrance to this dungeon](https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/zg-entrance.jpg) can be found in Northern Stranglethorn at the coordinates (72, 33).\n\nFirst, you have to set the instance difficulty to Heroic (you can't enter until you do).\n\n__Tor-Tun__ drops 5-8 x Volatile Earth. Don't kill any other bosses or you can't reset the instance!\n\nAfter you kill Tor-Tun, you can go outside and reset the instance by right-clicking over your own portrait then clicking "Reset all instances". You can only do 10 instance runs in an hour, so you will have to wait a bit since you will hit the instance cap in like 20 minutes." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/volatile-zulgurub.jpg
	a2_twilighthighlands >>> Area 2 - Twilight Highlands >>> "Sometimes you farm for 15 minutes and you don't get a single Volatile, this is just bad luck.\n\nYou can farm Volatile Earth in Twilight Highlands by killing __Obsidian Stoneslaves__. Do not forget that if you are a miner, you can mine the dead mobs and you will get more Volatile Earth." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/volatile-earth-twilight.jpg

	a1_vortexpinnacle >>> Area 1 - Vortex Pinnacle >>> "Vortex Pinnacle is the best place to farm Volatile Air, and you can easily solo this instance from level 100. You can find the entrance high in the air in the southeast part of the Uldum, over the ocean ([the exact map location](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/blog/2010-11/10/vortex-pinnacle.jpg)).\n\nFirst, set the instance difficulty to Normal (you can't reset the instance after you kill the first boss on Heroic).\n\nKill everything until the second boss Altairus, then just simply __jump down__, you won't die, it will teleport you to the start of the instance. Go outside and reset the instance by right-clicking over your own portrait then clicking "Reset all instances". You can only do 10 instance runs in an hour, this means sometimes you might have to wait a bit." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/volatile-air-vortex.jpg
	a2_uldum >>> Area 2 - Uldum >>> "Sometimes you farm for 15 minutes and you don't get a single Volatile, this is just bad luck.\n\nIf you are too low level to solo Vortex Pinnacle, you can farm __Scions of Al'Akir__. There are a lot of them at Uldum and they respawn very quickly. The drop rate is not that great, around 12%.\n\nIf you are an Engineer, you can farm Volatile Air with __Electrostatic Condenser__, but only if you have a gathering profession.\n\n__IMPORTANT!__ If you are level 120, you will see the patch 8.3 version of Uldum. You can talk to __Zidormi__ to switch between phases." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/volatile-air-uldum.jpg
