	a1_revendreth >>> Area 1 - Revendreth >>> "*Don't expect a lot of Shrouded Cloth if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\nYou can farm a lot of Shrouded Cloth from __Beleaguered Excavators__, __Excavation Enforcers__, __Nefarious Thugs__, and __Nefarious Collectors__ at Archivam in Revendreth. They are really close to each other, so you can make big pulls and AoE them down. The respawn rate is fast enough that you should never run out of mobs.\n\nThe only downside is that the Beleaguered Excavators are neutral so you can't pull them with your mount.\n\nYou can sell your stuff to __Nourman__ when your bags are full." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/shrouded-cloth-farming-revendreth-archivam.jpg
	a2_ardenweald >>> Area 2 - Ardenweald >>> "*Don't expect a lot of Shrouded Cloth if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\n__Blighted Fadeblades__ and __Masked Soulsplitters__ respawn really fast around the marked area. They hit a bit harder than the previous mobs, but if you have good gear you can easily pull 8-10 together with your mount." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/shrouded-cloth-farming-ardenwald-tirna.jpg

	a1_tiragardesound >>> Area 1 - Tiragarde Sound >>> "*Don't expect a lot of Tidespray Linen if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\nA really good place to farm Tidespray Linen is the __non-instanced__ version of Freehold in Tiragarde Sound. The mobs are really close to each other, so you can pull a bunch of mobs together then AoE them down. The respawn rate is not that fast, but if you do a full loop on the island, the mobs at the start should start respawning. Try to make a bigger loop around the island if you see that you kill them too fast and have to wait for respawns. (You can also use the bridges and go to other parts of Freehold.)" >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/tidespray-linen-tiragarde.jpg
	a2_zuldazar >>> Area 2 - Zuldazar >>> "*Don't expect a lot of Tidespray Linen if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\nThe Dark Iron dwarves at Xibala in Zuldazar respawn really fast, you can never run out of them." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/tidespray-linen-zuldazar.jpg

	a1_highmountain >>> Area 1 - Highmountain >>> "*Don't expect much cloth if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\nThere is a spot at Highmountain where __Mightstone Flankers__ and __Mightstone Slingers__ are fighting friendly NPCs and they respawn almost instantly after you kill them, so there are usually 4-7 mobs up. It's very possible that you will die a few times here if you pull too many of them. Try to get the last hits on low HP mobs, you can still loot them even if the NPC did the most damage to them.\n\nWatch out for the ranged mobs, if you aggro them, they will keep shooting you even if they are hitting another NPC." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/shaldorei-silk-highmountain.jpg
	a2_azsuna >>> Area 2 - Azsuna >>> "*Don't expect much cloth if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\nThere are a bunch of murlocs on the shore of this lake. Recommended for classes with good AoE.\n\nSometimes these mobs are required for a world quest and a lot of players will be killing them." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/shaldorei-silk-azsuna.jpg
	a3_valsharah >>> Area 3 - Val'sharah >>> "*Don't expect much cloth if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\nI recommend this place if you can only take down mobs one by one and you struggled at other places. You will farm __Wormtalon Witches__ and __Wormtalon Huntresses__." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/shaldorei-silk-valsharah.jpg
	a4_stormheim >>> Area 4 - Stormheim >>> "*Don't expect much cloth if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\nRuneaxe Training Grounds in Stormheim was designed in a way that there are always a few __Bonespeaker Runeaxes__ up. This means if you kill the last one, 2-3 new ones will pop up. With ranged class, you could basically stand in the middle of the camp and just keep killing mobs." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/shaldorei-silk-stormheim.jpg

	a1_eredath >>> Area 1 - Eredath >>> "*Don't expect much cloth if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\nThis is hands down the best place to farm, none of the places come even close to it. There are two marked spots, you can farm at both of them, the respawn rate is so fast you don't have to move between them, you can stay at the lower or the upper part." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/lightweave-cloth-mac-aree.jpg
	a2_antoranwastes >>> Area 2 - Antoran Wastes >>> "*Don't expect much cloth if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\nThese mobs hit really hard, I could only pull 3 at a time, but it will depend on your class how many you can handle. Tank spec might be able to pull all of them. A few mobs will instantly respawn when you kill the last one, so you can never run out of mobs to kill.\n\n__NOTE:__ Sometimes there is a rare elite at this spot, which makes it pretty hard to farm here." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/lightweave-cloth-antoran-wastes.jpg
	a3_krokuun >>> Area 3 - Krokuun >>> "*Don't expect much cloth if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\nA good alternative to the places mentioned above. Mobs will keep respawning, you will never run out of them." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/lightweave-cloth-krokuun.jpg
