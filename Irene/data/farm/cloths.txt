	a1_revendreth >>> Area 1 - Revendreth >>> "*Don't expect a lot of Shrouded Cloth if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\nYou can farm a lot of Shrouded Cloth from __Beleaguered Excavators__, __Excavation Enforcers__, __Nefarious Thugs__, and __Nefarious Collectors__ at Archivam in Revendreth. They are really close to each other, so you can make big pulls and AoE them down. The respawn rate is fast enough that you should never run out of mobs.\n\nThe only downside is that the Beleaguered Excavators are neutral so you can't pull them with your mount.\n\nYou can sell your stuff to __Nourman__ when your bags are full." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/shrouded-cloth-farming-revendreth-archivam.jpg
	a2_ardenweald >>> Area 2 - Ardenweald >>> "*Don't expect a lot of Shrouded Cloth if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\n__Blighted Fadeblades__ and __Masked Soulsplitters__ respawn really fast around the marked area. They hit a bit harder than the previous mobs, but if you have good gear you can easily pull 8-10 together with your mount." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/shrouded-cloth-farming-ardenwald-tirna.jpg

	a1_tiragardesound >>> Area 1 - Tiragarde Sound >>> "*Don't expect a lot of Tidespray Linen if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\nA really good place to farm Tidespray Linen is the __non-instanced__ version of Freehold in Tiragarde Sound. The mobs are really close to each other, so you can pull a bunch of mobs together then AoE them down. The respawn rate is not that fast, but if you do a full loop on the island, the mobs at the start should start respawning. Try to make a bigger loop around the island if you see that you kill them too fast and have to wait for respawns. (You can also use the bridges and go to other parts of Freehold.)" >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/tidespray-linen-tiragarde.jpg
	a2_zuldazar >>> Area 2 - Zuldazar >>> "*Don't expect a lot of Tidespray Linen if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\nThe Dark Iron dwarves at Xibala in Zuldazar respawn really fast, you can never run out of them." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/tidespray-linen-zuldazar.jpg
