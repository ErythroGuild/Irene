They are really close to each other, so you can make big pulls and AoE them down.

The mobs are really close to each other, so you can pull a bunch of mobs together then AoE them down. The respawn rate is not that fast, but if you do a full loop on the island, the mobs at the start should start respawning. Try to make a bigger loop around the island if you see that you kill them too fast and have to wait for respawns.

It's very possible that you will die a few times here if you pull too many of them. Try to get the last hits on low HP mobs, you can still loot them even if the NPC did the most damage to them.\n\nWatch out for the ranged mobs, if you aggro them, they will keep shooting you even if they are hitting another NPC." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/shaldorei-silk-highmountain.jpg

Tank spec might be able to pull all of them. A few mobs will instantly respawn when you kill the last one, so you can never run out of mobs to kill.\n\n__NOTE:__ Sometimes there is a rare elite at this spot, which makes it pretty hard to farm here." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/lightweave-cloth-antoran-wastes.jpg

So, basically you don't have to travel around, you can stand in one place and kill these mobs.\n\nCoordinates: (78.7, 72.2)\n\n__Note:__ There are two extra Tamed Clefthoofs near the Gorian Gladiators, and sometimes you have to kill those too to force a respawn." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/raw-beast-hide-nagrand.jpg
	a2_gorgrond >>> Area 2 - Gorgrond >>> "*Sumptuous Fur is dropped by beasts with fur, and from humanoids with fur.*\n\nKill Steamscar mobs at the middle of Gorgond, or Tailthrasher mobs at south Gorgond.

	a3_talador >>> Area 3 - Talador >>> "*Sumptuous Fur is dropped by beasts with fur, and from humanoids with fur.*\n\nKill Daggerjaw mobs at the two marked places. The respawn rate is really fast so you can farm at both of these places without downtime. I prefer to farm at the small lake north of Vol'jin's Pride because you can just do laps around the lake and most mobs will respawn after one lap." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/talador-sumptuous-fur.jpg

You will farm between two small camps, so you can use the flight master to fly between the two." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/spires-of-arak-sumptuous-fur2.jpg

	a1_dreadwastes >>> Area 1 - Dread Wastes >>> "*Tailors will get a lot more cloth than non-tailors.*\n\nDread Wastes is the best place to farm Windwool Cloth. You will farm five groups of 8 __Ik'thik Warriors__ and one __Ik'thik Slayer__.\n\n:bbul: Click on the clock under your minimap, then click on the stopwatch. Start timing after you kill the first pack of mobs.\n:bbul: Go to (58.13, 48.39). You can see this spot on the map below.\n:bbul: Kill the first mantid pack, then start moving towards Valley of the Four Winds and kill the 4 remaining Ik'thik Warriors groups. There is one elite scorpion and 3-4 mantids at the first two pack of Ik'thik Warriors. Only kill the scorpions and his guardians if you have decent gear.\n:bbul: After you kill the 5th pack of Ik'thik Warriors, check your clock. If it's at 3 minutes or more, you can go back where you started because the respawn rate is 3 minutes for these packs.\n:bbul: Decent geared players will have about 1 minute downtime before the mobs start respawning. Go to the spot marked with red X on the map, it's on the wall. Then stand near __Jonathan Jacobsen__. [Here is a screenshot](https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/dread-wastes-windwool.jpg).\n:bbul: You will see waves of Ik'thik Warriors flying over the wall, use any ranged ability to tag these mobs. Stay here until the first pack of mantids respawn (3 minutes from when you killed them).\n\nIf you have done some questing in Dread Wastes, you can get useful buffs from the Klaxxi." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/windwool-cloth-dread-wastes.jpg
