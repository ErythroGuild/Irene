	a1_thousandneedles >>> Area 1 - Thousand Needles >>> "Westreach Summit at Thousand Needles is almost the same as New Thalanar, but the mobs are a bit more spread apart. __Grimtotem Pillagers__ are battling with __Summit Defenders__ and they instantly respawn after the number of mobs in the area get low, which means you will never run out of them.\n\n__Note for Alliance players:__ This place is close to a Horde town, so lower level Alliance players should not go there, but for higher level Alliance players it doesn't really matter as long as you have some kind of AoE ability, you will oneshot mobs anyway. You should only farm here if you oneshot the guards because the guards drop no loot." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/silk-cloth-thousand-needles.jpg
	a2_badlands >>> Area 2 - Badlands >>> "The Dwarfs and Troggs inside the cave that leads to Uldaman drop a lot of Silk Cloth, so this is a great alternative if you can't farm at the previous places. Don't forget to clear the mobs outside the cave too! There are a lot of mobs up on the cliff to the right from the cave entrance.\n\nThe respawn rate is not that fast, so if you have a class with high mobility, you might clear the mobs too fast and you have to wait for respawns. (If this is the case, you should clear Uldman once while you wait for respawns.)" >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/silk-cloth-uldaman.jpg

However, if you have the __Chauffeured Chopper__ mount, you will be considered a passenger and you won't get dismounted. If you don't have the __Chauffeured Chopper__, just try to pull as many mobs with your mount as possible.\n\n__IMPORTANT!__ If you have flying, in addition to the instance, you can fly behind the portal to the non-instanced version of Zul'Farrak. If you head to the [spot where the execution area is](https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/mageweave-zf-outside.jpg) with the big stairs that looks like a small pyramid, there are about 100 mobs there. You should kill these mobs before every instance run. Respawn time is about 3-4 minutes.\n\nOnce you are inside, you should __ALWAYS__ open __Shallow Graves__. The graves are located near __Witch Doctor Zum'rah__. When you open these, zombies will spawn and they also drop Mageweave Cloth.\n\nAfter you clear the instance, go outside and reset it by right-clicking over your own portrait, then click "Reset all instances". You can only do 10 instance runs in an hour, this means sometimes you might have to wait a bit." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/mageweave-cloth-zul-farrak.jpg

These mobs are in packs of three and the place is designed in a way that there is always at least 3 packs up. This means a new pack of mobs will spawn instantly when the number of packs in the area is down to 3.\n\n__NOTE:__ Some of the packs are a bit harder to notice, [here is a picture of all the packs in the area](https://www.wow-professions.com/images/silk-epl.jpg).\n\nSometimes this place is heavily farmed." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/silk-cloth-epl.jpg
	a4_tanaris >>> Area 4 - Tanaris >>> "Farming __Dunemaul Ogres__ in Tanaris is a good alternative if you can't farm at Eastern Plaguelands.

	a1_blackrockdepths >>> Area 1 - Blackrock Depths >>> "Level 40+ is recommended to farm here, but you should be at least level 35.\n\nBlackrock Depths is currently the best place to farm Runecloth. One clear takes about 6-7 minutes, so you might hit the 10 instance/hour limit if you clear it too fast.\n\nTo get to Blackrock Depths, enter __Blackrock Mountain__ from either southwest Searing Gorge or northwest Burning Steppes. Go onto the big rock suspended in the center. Follow the stairs down and exit downwards onto the chain at the bottom. A passage leads right to get to the instance. Bear left in the cave and the instance is at the end of the chamber.

	a2_silithus >>> Area 2 - Silithus >>> "Killing __Twilight Cultists__ in Silithus is also a good place to farm. It seems if you farm at the Twilight Base Camp, you will never run out of mobs, because the respawn is really fast. But if you do run out of mobs just go to Twilight Post and move between these two camps.\n\n__NOTE:__ Some of these mobs currently scale to your level all the way up to 50. I'm not sure if this is a bug, or if it's intended, but despite this, it's still a really good place. If you have bad gear, you can just avoid the mobs in the middle of the camp and farm around the edges.\n\n__IMPORTANT!__ Silithus will be phased after completing/accepting certain quests. But, if you talk to __Zidormi__, she will allow you to switch between phased versions of Silithus." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/runecloth-silithus.jpg
