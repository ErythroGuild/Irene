	revendreth_a1 >>> Revendreth (area 1) >>> "*Don't expect a lot of Shrouded Cloth if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\nYou can farm a lot of Shrouded Cloth from __Beleaguered Excavators__, __Excavation Enforcers__, __Nefarious Thugs__, and __Nefarious Collectors__ at Archivam in Revendreth. They are really close to each other, so you can make big pulls and AoE them down. The respawn rate is fast enough that you should never run out of mobs.\n\nThe only downside is that the Beleaguered Excavators are neutral so you can't pull them with your mount.\n\nYou can sell your stuff to __Nourman__ when your bags are full." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/shrouded-cloth-farming-revendreth-archivam.jpg

	tiragardesound_a1 >>> Tiragarde Sound (area 1) >>> "*Don't expect a lot of Tidespray Linen if you farm without Tailoring.*\n\nA really good place to farm Tidespray Linen is the __non-instanced__ version of Freehold in Tiragarde Sound. The mobs are really close to each other, so you can pull a bunch of mobs together then AoE them down. The respawn rate is not that fast, but if you do a full loop on the island, the mobs at the start should start respawning. Try to make a bigger loop around the island if you see that you kill them too fast and have to wait for respawns. (You can also use the bridges and go to other parts of Freehold.)" >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/tidespray-linen-tiragarde.jpg
