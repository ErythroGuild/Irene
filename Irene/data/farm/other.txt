	scrapping >>> Scrapping >>> "The drop rate seems to be between 16 and 17%. On average, you will get one Expulsom for every 6 gear pieces scrapped. You will always get one Expulsom from scrapping a *non-crafted* trinket.\n\nSince the quality of the items doesn't matter, crafting the cheapest Tailoring and Leatherworking items from the Battle for Azeroth expansion is the best way to get a lot of Expulsom.\n\n:bbul: __Shimmerscale Armguards__ - Leatherworking\n:bbul: __Coarse Leather Armguards__ - Leatherworking\n:bbul: __Tidespray Linen Bracers__ - Tailoring\n\n__Tidespray Linen Bracers__ is usually the cheapest to craft.\n\n*Expulsom is __soulbound__! Make sure that you mail the items you craft before you start scrapping them.*" >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/scrapper-location-bfa.jpg

	heartoffear_a1 >>> Heart of Fear (area 1) >>> "Farming the trash mobs before the first boss in "Raid Finder" Heart of Fear is the best way to farm Spirit of Harmony.\n\nHeart of Fear is a level 35 raid instance, but every level 45+ character can easily solo this.\n\nTo enter "Raid Finder" Heart of Fear, talk to __Lorewalker Han__ in the Seat of Knowledge above Mogu'shan Palace at the Vale of Eternal Blossom. You have to fly up, he is located at the 2nd level of the building.\n\n:bbul: Clear the first two rooms, but __*DON'T KILL THE FIRST BOSS*__! (The boss will spawn after you clear all trash in the room.)\n:bbul: After you loot the trash mobs, right click on your own portrait and click on "Leave Instance Group".\n:bbul: Once outside, right click on your portrait again and click on "Reset all instances".\n\nYou can only reset an instance 10 times in an hour." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/spirit-of-harmony-lfr-heart.jpg
	townlongsteppes_a2 >>> Townlong Steppes (area 2) >>> "Sra'Vess is a great alternative if you can't solo Heart of Fear." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/windwool-sraves.jpg
	valleyofthefourwinds_a3 >>> Valley of the Four Winds (area 3) >>> "This place is only accessible if you have a flying mount. The __Stout Shaghorns__ located here are roaming in packs of six, but they are not hostile which means you can kill them one by one if you don't have enough AoE dps to nuke them down. The respawn rate is really fast, it seems like there is always at least one pack up." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/exotic-leather-valley-90.jpg
	kunlaisummit_a4 >>> Kun-Lai Summit (area 4) >>> "Howlingwind Cavern in Kun-Lai summit is also a decent place to farm. You will find __Mischievous Snow Sprites__ and __Suspicious Snow Piles__ in the cave. You can open the snow piles by stepping on them or using AoE spells." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/windwool-cloth-kun-lai.jpg
