	r1_revendreth >>> Route 1 - Revendreth >>> "This route is probably going to get nerfed.\n\nThe ores are respawning extremely quickly around this area in Revendreth (seems pretty broken, to be honest). You will probably never even have to leave the yellow route, but if the ores are not respawning fast enough you can make a small detour to the red route." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/laestrite-ore-farming-revendreth-route1.jpg
	r2_bastion >>> Route 2 - Bastion >>> "I think this area is also going to get nerfed, it just seems too good.\n\n*This area will be filled with friendly mobs and no mining nodes until you progress your Bastion Story Campaign quests!*\n\nThe mining nodes respawn really quickly on this route, but there are a lot of hostile mobs guarding the mining nodes, so you will still need somewhat decent gear to kill the mobs. Check the other two routes if you can't handle the mobs (or if this route got nerfed)." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/laestrite-farming-bastion-route-1.jpg
	r3_bastion >>> Route 3 - Bastion >>> "Really good route, you can avoid fighting most mobs." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/laestrite-farming-bastion-route-2.jpg

	r1_maldraxxus >>> Route 1 - Maldraxxus >>> "There is not that much difference between the two, I personally prefer route 1 because it's a bit shorter. You will have to fight mobs on both routes, but with some practice, you can usually get most mining nodes with aggroing only a few mobs, or nothing at all." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/oxxein-ore-farming-maldraxxus-route-1.jpg

	r1_ardenweald >>> Route 1 - Ardenweald >>> "It's very hard to avoid hostile mobs around the edges of the map, so this route loops around the center of the map where there are fewer mobs. You will still have to fight mobs at certain parts of this route, but overall, I farmed the most ore using this route. " >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/phaedrum-ore-farming-ardenweald-route-1.jpg
	r2_ardenweald >>> Route 2 - Ardenweald >>> "This route basically just loops around the other side of the map, so you have an alternative farming route if the other route is farmed by someone else. You can try to extend the route to the red lines if you have good gear (or if you have something like Feign Death)." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/phaedrum-ore-farming-ardenweald-route-2.jpg

	r2_revendreth >>> Route 2 - Revendreth >>> "There are parts with a lot of hostile mobs on this route, so you can't really avoid aggroing mobs. But since the ores don't spawn at the upper parts of Revendreth and they had to put ores somewhere, it seems this route has a lot more ores than farming routes in other zones." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/sinvyr-ore-farming-revendreth-route2.jpg

	r1_maw >>> Route 1 - The Maw >>> "This route avoids most areas with a high density of mobs, so most classes can use this route. There is usually only 1 or 2 mobs that you will have to fight at each ore." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/elethium-ore-farming-route-1.jpg
	r2_maw >>> Route 2 - The Maw >>> "This is basically the same route, but it goes through one extra area that has a lot of mobs.

If you notice that you farm too fast, and the nodes are not respawning, you can take a bigger loop in the zone and follow the red route, but the respawn rate should be fast enough on the yellow route." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/monelite-ore-nazmir-s.jpg

Don't forget to check the caves marked with red Xs, sometimes the ores are deep inside the cave and you can't see them on your map until you go inside.\n\nA bunch of mobs will be everywhere, so it's pretty bad to farm this ore until you get flying. Use the recommended enchants or you will get dismounted every second." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/osmenite-ore-nazjatar1.jpg
