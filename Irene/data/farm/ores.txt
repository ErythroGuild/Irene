If you are struggling to mine there, you could just simply skip that part.\n\nIf you have a hunter, that's one of the best classes for farming, because you can use __Feign Death__ at almost every mining node, so you will have to kill a lot fewer mobs. Druids and rogues are also good because of stealth." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/empyrium-krokuun.jpg

Unfortunately, this battle happens every 1 hour. But in that 1 hour time period, Wintergrasp is the best zone for farming Saronite.\n\n__Warning!__ Sometimes there is a bug, and you can't see any mining nodes or NPCs in the zone.

The only good thing about this farming route is that it's pretty easy to follow the route. You can watch Netflix or Twitch while farming here. You don't really have to pay that much attention to where you go.\n\nThere are two caves marked with red circles on the map. You should go inside both of them and make sure that you go all the way to the end because sometimes you won't see the mining nodes from the entrance." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/fel-iron-ore-farming-zangarmarsh.jpg

Just like in Nagrand, I marked the caves with red circles on the map. But, you should only go inside if you have stealth or if there are a lot of other people farming in the zone. These are much bigger than the Nagrand caves, and the mobs are a lot higher level.

Even Horde players can go there with flying. I was able to get 200 Copper Ore with just one lap in this zone.\n\n__IMPORTANT!__ If you are level 110, you will see an updated map of Darkshore.

You will find a mountain called Deadmaul Rock, there are loads of Mithril Deposits inside the caves there, but you have to fight mobs and you will get dismounted if you go inside. I think it's better to skip the caves, because there is plenty of Mithril at the corner of the map if you just follow the route I recommend." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/mithril-ore-burning-steppes.jpg

This zone has an easy and simple loop to follow.\n\nI marked a cave with a red X on the map, only go there if your level is a lot higher than the mobs' level in the cave. It's full of Mithril but there is a bunch of mobs there, so you will actually get less Mithril if you can't kill the mobs fast enough." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/mithril-ore-badlands.jpg

Fly __down__ to the [location marked with X on the map](https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/mc-entrance.jpg). To enter the instance, you have to talk to __Lothos Riftwaker__, and he will teleport you to Molten Core.\n\nFollow the route on the map below, mine every Dark Iron Deposit, and try to avoid pulling the bosses. It's crucial that you __DON'T KILL ANY OF THE BOSSES__, or this farming method won't work! If you accidentally pull a boss, try to run away as far as you can. Most bosses will reset if you pull them too far.\n\nYou can only do 10 instances in an hour, but mining every Dark Iron Deposit takes around 10 minutes, so you won't hit that cap. __If you kill any of the bosses, this method won't work, you can't reset Molten Core once you kill a boss there.__" >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/dark-iron-ore-mc.jpg
