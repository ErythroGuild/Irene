	a1_maldraxxus >>> Area 1 - Maldraxxus >>> "The best way to get a lot of Creeping Crawler Meat is farming __Sloughskin Nymph__ and __Devouring Sloughskin__ in Maldraxxus. The respawn rate of these are pretty fast, you will probably never run out of them, but they often spawn a bit far away from you, so sometimes you have to mount up to move to the other part of this area. The __Sloughskin Larva__ don't drop any meat, but you can't really avoid killing them.\n\nYou will also find a lot of __Ossein Drone__ and __Ossein Worker__ around this area, but you should mostly focus on the other mobs because it seems those have a higher drop rate." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/creeping-crawler-meat-farming-maldraxxus-1.jpg

There are always at least 4-5 mobs up inside the cave, and a new one will instantly spawn if their numbers would go below that.
