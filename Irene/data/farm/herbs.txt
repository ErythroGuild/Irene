You can find Rain Poppy in Vale of Eternal Blossoms too, but there are so few of them, you will always have to wait for respawns. Rain Poppy can be found near water all over the zone, so you usually only have to look for places where there is water. For some reason it won't spawn on every part of the river, only on the parts I drew the route.\n\nThere is an Alliance town at Pearl Lake, so Horde players might not be able to pick every herb there, or you can just kill the elite guards, they are not hard to kill." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/rain-poppy-jade-forest.jpg

Fool's Cap is pretty rare, so it's best to combine these two zones for farming. But if someone else is farming in the zones, you pretty much won't find a single herb because there are so few places where it spawns.\n\nWhile traveling in Dread Wastes, you should pick _Sha-Touched Herb_ as long as you can pick it without pulling a bunch of mobs. There is a 17% chance that it will contain Fool's Cap." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/fools-cap-townlong-dread.jpg
