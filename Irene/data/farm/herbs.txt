	r1_ardenweald >>> Route 1 - Ardenweald >>> "I gathered the most Vigil's Torch by just simply doing a giant loop in the whole zone. There are a few dangerous parts with a lot of mobs, so *if you don't have the __Sky Golem__ mount, or you are not a druid, I would recommend trying Route 3 instead of this one*." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/vigils-torch-farming-ardenweald-route-1.jpg

	r3_ardenweald >>> Route 3 - Ardenweald >>> "This route avoids almost all hostile mobs, I recommended this farming route for players without the __Sky Golem__ mount or players with bad gear." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/vigils-torch-farming-ardenweald-route-3.jpg

	r1_revendreth >>> Route 1 - Revendreth >>> "I gathered the most Widowbloom by doing a loop in the lower part of Revendreth. There is a lift at the red line, so you have to wait for it to come up, or you can just jump down if you have any ability that you can use to survive the fall. Also, there are a few elite mobs before the lift, so if you are having trouble there, you can just go around that whole area skipping the lift and the elites." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/widowbloom-farming-revendreth-route-1.jpg
	r2_revendreth >>> Route 2 - Revendreth >>> "This is also a good route, but I got a bit fewer herbs overall. The red line is filled with elites, you should only go there if you have a tanking spec *and* also a way to gather herbs while mounted. But even then you might die, so I usually just recommend skipping that part. There are also elites in the lower part that area, but they are much easier to avoid.\n\nThe red X is the location of __Stonehead__. This NPC won't let you pass, if you approach him, he will pick you up and throw you. But, there is a crack in the wall to the north where you can pass." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/widowbloom-farming-revendreth-route-2.jpg

	r2_maw >>> Route 2 - The Maw >>> "This is basically the same route, but it goes through one extra area that has a lot of mobs. It's up to you to decide if it's worth to take the small detour to get those extra herbs." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/nightshade-farming-maw-route-2.jpg
	r3_bastion >>> Route 3 - Bastion >>> "If you want to farm Nightshade outside of the Maw, you have to farm other herbs and hope they will respawn as Nightshade.\n\nI gathered the most herbs using this route." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/rising-glory-bastion-route-1.jpg

	r3_drustvar >>> Route 3 - Drustvar >>> "You will also get some Star Moss, Anchor Weed, and Siren's Pollen here.

	r4_drustvar >>> Route 4 - Drustvar >>> "You will only find Winter's Kiss at Gol Koval, but there are usually 7-8 herbs there, so you can still get a decent amount of Winter's Kiss, but this is nowhere near as good as the first two routes." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/winters-kiss-dustvar3-s.jpg
