There are a few dangerous parts with a lot of mobs, so *if you don't have the __Sky Golem__ mount, or you are not a druid, I would recommend trying Route 3 instead of this one*." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/vigils-torch-farming-ardenweald-route-1.jpg

	revendreth_r1 >>> Revendreth (route 1) >>> "I gathered the most Widowbloom by doing a loop in the lower part of Revendreth. There is a lift at the red line, so you have to wait for it to come up, or you can just jump down if you have any ability that you can use to survive the fall. Also, there are a few elite mobs before the lift, so if you are having trouble there, you can just go around that whole area skipping the lift and the elites." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/widowbloom-farming-revendreth-route-1.jpg
	revendreth_r2 >>> Revendreth (route 2) >>> "This is also a good route, but I got a bit fewer herbs overall. The red line is filled with elites, you should only go there if you have a tanking spec *and* also a way to gather herbs while mounted. But even then you might die, so I usually just recommend skipping that part. There are also elites in the lower part that area, but they are much easier to avoid.\n\nThe red X is the location of __Stonehead__. This NPC won't let you pass, if you approach him, he will pick you up and throw you. But, there is a crack in the wall to the north where you can pass." >>> https://www.wow-professions.com/images/farmingmaps/widowbloom-farming-revendreth-route-2.jpg
