ksmstarterpack=:map: **KSM Starter Pack** :compass:\n*Recommended addons*\n:emsp: **Astral Keys:** *keep track of what keys your toons / guildies / party members have*\n:emsp: **MDT:** *plan out routes in advance, view trash count and abilities*\n\n*Mindset*\n:emsp: \u2022 Focus on yourself. *Everybody* has room to improve, *every pull*. Staring at other people won't make *you* play better.\n:emsp: \u2022 Failing isn't bad. Wiping isn't bad. Getting hit isn't bad. Experience is the best teacher.\n:emsp: \u2022 It doesn't matter where you begin. If you keep improving, you *can't help* but get there.\n:emsp: \u2022 Stay positive! You'll improve faster *and* have a better time doing it.\n\n*How do I get better?*\n:emsp: \u25E6 **Focus on a few things** at a time. Try to improve just a couple things until you have them down.\n:emsp: \u25E6 **Reflect.** How can *I* improve? Was there an amazing save I could have pulled off?\n:emsp: \u25E6 **Press buttons more.** How many more <insert 3min cd>s can I squeeze in?\n:emsp: \u25E6 **Use your entire kit.** Am I using decurse? shadowmeld? demonic gateway? pet abilities? etc. ...\n:emsp: \u25E6 **Communicate.** If you interrupt a pack then your teammate stuns it, it's the same as if you forgot to.\n:emsp: \u25E6 **Try things.** Can I BoF this? invis? Does knockback stop this cast? Does this cast prefer ranged targets?\n:emsp: \u25E6 **Push boundaries.** Can we pull these packs at once? Try a key that's scary-high. What if...\n:emsp: \u25E6 **Keys, keys, keys.** There is no substitute for running more keys (and keys, and keys). :key:\n\n... and, have fun! :partying_face: There's no point in getting KSM if you uninstall right after. :face_with_spiral_eyes:
