bestspec=**Play what you enjoy playing the most.**\nThere are actually quite a few good reasons for this!\n\n:bbul: Although there is usually a :+-:5% dps difference between specs, people often do 50% *or less* of their theoretical dps. Your time is *probably* better spent on a training dummy, rather than gearing a new toon, as boring as that sounds.\n:bbul: This is a game, and enjoying it is a good thing! You'll be more motivated to improve, *and less likely to burn out*, if you're playing something you enjoy.\n:bbul: The top players in our guild are rarely, if ever, meta specs. (And there *have* been people who switched to meta specs and couldn't compete.)\n\nOf course, this does *not* mean you should not play meta specs at all, rather, you should have a reason for choosing that spec beyond just "it does more damage". The best spec is the spec you like to play. :+1:
