This project wouldn't be possible without *everyone* who answered my
questions, provided suggestions and feedback, and tested the bot.
The following is an incomplete list of people who have helped, in no
particular order.

---

**Amber**, for moral support, encouragement, testing, and putting up
with me ♥

**Void**, **Violet**, **Slumbers**, and **Neko**, for testing the bot

**Velvet**, **Lunar**, and the rest of **the D#+ discord server**,
for help with library issues

and **everyone in \<Erythro\>**, for testing, feedback, and tolerating
all the random glitches during development
